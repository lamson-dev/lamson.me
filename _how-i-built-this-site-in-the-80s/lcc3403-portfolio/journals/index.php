    <h1 class="post-title">Started Playing Game (MMORPG) Again, But From A Different
        Perspective</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Game? MMORPG? Oh, Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. I
            didn't know what it meant until I googled it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Yes, I played this genre of video games before when I was in... 8th grade. I was addicted in
            playing these games with my 'online' friends for years. We started playing Priston Tale,
            then moved to Silkroad, then another game that I can't recall its name (because I didn't
            play it for long). We sort of built up our friendship 'online', and then 'offline'. It was
            fun! I loved it... until one day I realized that I didn't log in to the game to actually
            play game anymore. I logged in to see if my friends were 'online', so I could train my
            character and chatted with them. Not so long after, I stopped playing MMORPG, and it has
            been 7 years already.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now looking back, I didn't enjoy playing the game. I enjoyed the community that the game
            had. Logging into World of Warcraft last week brought back some memories, I was excited, but
            with complete different feelings than before.
        </p>

        <p>
            This time, I actually watched the cinemas, carefully chose my character and customized it. I
            spent literally more than half an hour just to create my character. I paid so much more
            attention to every single details some how. First thing I noticed after entered the game was
            the graphics. It is different than the games I played, not saying it is better or worst,
            it's just unique in its own ways that I guess people who played this game before can tell it
            is WoW by just briefly look at it. I spent more time running around in the game, zooming
            closer to the characters, monsters, and searching for cool things. Here are some screenshots
            on what I think it's kinda cool:</p>
        <br/> <br/>

        Some random broom wiping by itself and a huge diamond that had eyes on it... guess what? The
        eyes follow you!

            alt=""/>A beautiful view that I found...
        <br/><br/>

        <p>
            I didn't like to play the game anymore, but I actually enjoyed the first couple hours
            exploring the world in WoW, from a different perspective, I think. It's a complete different
            experience for me now. I don't want to train my character to level up and be competitive, I
            just hope to search for more unexpected stuff that the game creators put into this game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not sure if anyone has the same experience in playing MMORPG like me, or I'm just a weird
            kid who can't play game :P
        </p>

        <p>
            By the way, here is <a title="Son's PechaKucha Presentation"

    <h1 class="post-title">Infographics – Learn, Create, Share</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This week in class we touched on of the most popular forms of social
            content - infographics. I am personally a very big fan of this form for a number of reasons.
            One of them is that infographics are so easy to digest for me. I can probably see an
            infographic once and remember its content for a very long time. Infographics are cool. They
            visually present complex information, data or knowledge quickly and clearly. Some people
            think of it as idea art, where they creatively present their ideas in a way that most people
            can understand.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have always wanted to create an infographic for myself, but with my lack of creative
            skills, it never happens until I got to create one with my group this week. It's actually
            much harder than I thought. I couldn't think of a definition on what we should present to
            the class. Later after receiving some inputs from our group members, we decided to choose
            our definition as 'Fighting as a Blood Elf Hunter'. The reason why we chose this was that
            all of the my group members, yes, all of us have character Blood Elf with class Hunter. We
            recorded our thoughts on a piece of paper, then tried to process and refine the ideas.
            Finally, we gathered all the pieces, put it together and finished our (or my) first
            infographic on the board. We had a picture of a Blood Elf character, some definitions of the
            character and the hunter class, a couple pets pictures, skills with names, and some data on
            the number of Blood Elf characters over all characters, over Horde, etc. I'm not sure if we
            did it the right way. We didn't have enough time to receive feedbacks from the professor.
            But to be honest, I didn't like our infographic that much. I felt like something was missing
            in our infographic, or... a poster to me. I wished we had more time to put in something that
            can show some kind of patterns and trends in it. Oh well, maybe it just me being critical
            and expected something more impressive than what we had.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of class, all the groups get to share their infographics. I think it was great to
            get to see other people ideas, and how they represented it. As expected, all the
            infographics were informative, easy to digest, and cool! None of the infographics
            represented the same way, but the progress of creating one is very similar. I think the
            students did explore new ways to inform. If we spent more time on these infographics, it
            could definitely be shareable on all over the internet, especially on social networks.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm really looking forward to working on my next infographic for project 2. Hopefully some
            creative idea will pop up in my head so that I can create a good one to share with the
            class. Talking about sharing, here are a couple cool infographics that I found:

        </p>

        <p>
            P/S: Maybe this journal is sort of off topic from WoW, but it's a reflection on infographics
            from me. I hope this is okay, if not please let me know so that I won't post on this type
            again.

    <h1 class="post-title">Reached Level 10 & Discovered Transportation Services</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This week, my character reached level 10! It's time to explore World of Warcraft a
            little bit more.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I have been doing quests, killing monsters in the Blood Elf map area for a while. I easily got bored by
            the time I reached level 9. I wondered if WoW was dry like this, I expected more in this game. I kept
            playing to achieve my goal this week, which is to reach level 10 just to be able to join a group to get in
            the dungeon in class. Sweeet! That's my reaction when I reached level 10. WoW showed a bunch of popups
            telling me that I have new skills/spells for both my character and its pet, and one of the popups asked me
            to choose a specialization for my character. I carefully read all the Hunter specialization descriptions,
            and looked up for more information on WoW wiki.
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
            I decided to choose Marksmanship for my characters for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- I like to cause bigger damage to a mob on a single shot to kill them faster</li>
            <li>- I like to use a variety of skills/spells onto a mob</li>
            <li>- I don't like to control more than one thing at a time, which I assume I need to control my character
                as
                well as its pets if I chose Beast Mastery
            </li>
            <li>- Survival spec seems very vague to me... does it means I need to set up traps and lure mobs to it?</li>
            <li>- Also, since I most likely will not play WoW again after LCC 3403, so I don't think I'll reach levels
                25.My character will have more skills from now until level 20 if it specializes in Marksmanship.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of the problems being a low level character in the game is that you pretty much have to travel
            everywhere on your feet, and yes, it's very slow. Later in the game, a quest requires me to travel to a
            different area on the map. I discovered that I can talk to a flight master and ask for a dragonhawk. It was
            so cool. I did not expect there are transportation services like this in the game. I thought the only way I
            could travel faster is to use some sort of portals (like the ones in the games I used to play), or get a
            mount.</p>

        <p>

            Later in the week when I needed to join the class to go into the dungeon, I had no idea how to travel to
            Orgrimmar. When I got to Orgrimmar to meet up with the group, I discovered a couple more transportation
            services - the portals and zeppelins. To travel to Silvermoon to Orgrimmar, I needed to take the portal at
            Silvermoon to Undercity, then took the zeppelin service to Orgrimmar. I really really like the zeppelin
            service. It's like the bus service where you have to wait at the station for the next bus to come give you a
            ride. Some thing I have never experienced in the previous MMO games that I played. Here is what I learned:
        </p>

        <p>
            - Portals are free and provided by a few cities to travel between major cities. Based on WoW wiki, there is
            only one portal that can be used to go both ways, the one in Silvermoon City &amp; Undercity.
            - Zeppelin services are free as well. It helps you to travel between two continents and to locations where
            it's harder to travel to via flight path.
            - Flight Masters are the people you can talk to to travel to various connected points for a fee, as long as
            you have traveled there before.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to WoW wiki, there are many more ways to travel in WoW that I haven't discovered it yet. I am
            really impressed on how the world is developed in this game. Yes, I was wrong when I thought that WoW is
            kinda dry. But now I think I can expect a lot more cool things that I will discover in this world.

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>My infographic shows some interesting statistics in WoW in terms of the number of characters
            created, number of hours WoW player spend on average to play this game, and a few updates on my progress in
            WoW.

        <br/> <br/>

        <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Process: </strong></p>

        <p style="text-align: left">At first, I sort of misunderstood the purpose of the infographic for project 2. So
            when
            I brainstormed ideas for it, I didn't think of that I should have information about my character and its
            progress in the game. My idea was more general. It's about WoW characters as a whole, then narrow it down
            into
            smaller, more specific information. Also I wanted to add some random statistics in comparison with WoW
            statistics. I hope it would make my infographic more interesting to read.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">Later when I received feedbacks from Prof. Joy, I needed to add some information,
            statistics of my character into the infographic. It was difficult for me to think of any related information
            that I could add. I decided to add in some number about my progress in WoW. I think it's sort of related but
            I'm
            not sure if the audience has the same thoughts or not.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Self evaluation based on my grading criteria:</strong></p>

        <p style="text-align: left">- Use of graphics, creativity: I think I had good use of graphics in my
            inforgraphics.
            My favorite part is the pie chart with 10 blood elf characters, to show the number of characters created in
            terms of female and male characters. I wouldn't say that my infographic is creative. Although I tried my
            best to
            have relevant WoW fonts on my inforgraphic in stead of the general ones so that the audience can feel like
            they
            are reading relevant information about WoW.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">- Use of data: The number of characters created in both U.S. and Europe Realm is
            interesting in my opinion. Then I narrowed the statistics down to smaller numbers. I think there is enough
            data
            presented in a small poster. However, I think the data about my progress is some what related but not
            really. I
            wish I could do it better.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">- Relevance of information: The data is relevant to WoW. It shows the audience who
            plays
            WoW or knows about WoW some interesting information about the game, as well as my progress in WoW. I think
            it's
            good enough for the audience to get the general idea about what I tried to present.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">- Compact, easy to read, easy to digest: The fonts I chose are easy too read. The
            graphics are not too distracted, and the charts are easy to understand. Some big numbers in larger size
            emphasizes some important, interesting data. The color scheme I chose is good in my opinion. I think the
            audience will like my infographic.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">- Message communicated? I think my infographic presented pretty good general
            demographics about WoW in a small poster. The message is comunicated, I think, since I created it but I'm
            not
            sure if the audience feels the same. I hope to get more feedback from the audience so that I can do a better
            job
            next time.</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">Based on the rubric, here are the scores (self-evaluated):</p>

        <p style="text-align: left">- (4) Rhetorical Awareness
            - (5) Stance and Support
            - (4) Organization

    <h1 class="post-title">Reflection on Journal Spotlight Presentation</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This week was a slow week for me. Beside forming teams on Tuesday, I only had my journal
            spotlight presentation on Thursday. I haven't got a chance to play WoW for 2 weeks. My character hasn't even
            reached level 15 yet. I guess I could talk about my presentation for a little bit since I don't have much
            updates on my progress in WoW.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first, I didn't read the requirement for the presentation. I had a vague idea that I needed to stand in
            front
            of the class and talk about my favorite journal. On the day before the presentation, I found out that I
            needed
            powerpoint slides. I was like 'duhhh', of course I need the slides so it will help me to present better.
        </p>

        <p>
            I thought I my preparation for the presentation was adequate because I made the slides and went through it a
            day
            before. But later on presentation day, there was one important thing that I completely forgot about. I
            forgot to
            dress up! I had my shorts and a t-shirt with sport shoes and didn't realize that I needed something 'more'
            formal until a friend of mine noticed it and told me. Fortunately, it was not a requirement for this
            presentation. I asked the professor and she said it was okay for now, but later presentation in LCC will
            require
            the presenters to dress up.
        </p>

        <p>
            My presentation went better than I expected, but I don't think it's as good as the other presenters'. I had
            fun
            presenting my favorite journal, which is the first one that I wrote about my perspective in WoW. I added a
            little bit more about the game community that I used to be in. Some of the classmates had similar experience
            with their game communities as well and they participated in the discussion after my presentation. I'm glad
            that
            I caught, not all, but some students' attention. And here is couple tips that I learned:
            - Eye contact is very important! It shows your confidence, as well as makes sure that you're interested in
            presenting the information to the audience. If you don't make eye contact, it's easy for your audience to
            lose
            interest in your presentation.
            - Prepare some questions to ask during discussion and listen to the audience feedbacks. It helps you (or at
            least for me) to come up with more questions later to keep leading the discussion.

    <h1 class="post-title">Reflection – Music Video Games</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>My favorite chapter in 'How to do things in video games" by Bogost is chapter 4 - Music. I
            love music, and I love to play music. I was really excited when I got to this chapter, however, its content
            was
            different than what I expected. The author mostly mentioned about music video games rather than the music in
            video games. Even though the chapter didn't talk a lot about music in video games, it is still interesting
            to
            read.
        </p>

        <p>
            Music is a medium to carry a message in entirely. In this chapter, Bogost started with a brief history of
            music
            and how music served a liturgical purpose from early first millennium. New styles of music in the twentieth
            century secularized the sacred traditions of music. He gave a few examples on how music is often used in
            isolation today, touched on how music videos were popularized by MTV. Later, in the growth of television
            usage,
            video games entered the domain of music.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bogost discussed a few music video games such as Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Dance Dance Revolution, Singstar,
            etc.
            I played Guitar Hero and Rock Band before. For those who haven't played these music video games yet, these
            are
            music rhythm games which player uses a instrument-shaped controller (guitar, drum, microphone, etc.) to
            simulate
            playing across numerous music songs. Guitar Hero was very popular back in the day. I don't play it anymore
            because I switched to a play a different rhythm music game - Rocksmith, which I can use an actual real
            guitar to
            play! These games are awesome!
        </p>

        <p>
            An argument Bogost mentioned in this chapter is whether or not fake instruments would replace the real
            engagement. I never thought of this before because I didn't play these games that much. However, I could say
            this maybe truth because Guitar Hero was addictive. I would play the game everyday if I had a game console
            at my
            house. A research study showed that more than half gamers play music video games, and one fifth of these
            people
            would actually pick up the real instruments after playing these games. This is the opposite of what I
            thought it
            would be. But what if you are an expert in playing these games, would you consider yourself a musician?
            Probably
            not. Bogost said experienced gamers would have greater depth of understanding as listeners if they play
            these
            games but would not lead to a greater state of mastery as a musician.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, either you play real music of music video games, they both are playable and offering listeners and
            operators expressive experience within the framework of melody and rhythm. I think this is a good point
            because
            I've experienced both. Playing Guitar Hero in the past somewhat helped me to become a better listener, and
            be
            able to quickly learn how to play the guitar, interestingly.

    <h1 class="post-title">How many quests are there in WoW?</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>As the title of this post asked, how many quests are there in WoW? 200, 2000, 4000, or
            more?
            I am curious about this question, so that I went to google to see if I can get an exact number of quests in
            the
            game.
        </p>

        <p>

            According to this post <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7924142792">"How many quest are
                there in
                the game?"</a> on WoW Battlenet forum, a couple level 90 players mentioned that they have completed more
            than 15,000 quests, which more than 10,000 of them were daily quests. When I read of this number, I was
            like:
            "Whaaaattt? No wayyyy!!" This number is shocking to me. I questioned how come there are so many quests in
            the
            game, so I decided to do a bit research on quests in WoW.
        </p>

        <p>
            A quest is a task given to a player character that yields a reward when completed. Rewards can be experience
            points (XP) or game items. According to WoW Wiki, there are currently more than 9,500 quests in WoW. The
            initial
            design had only 100 horde quests, 100 alliance quests and 100 neutral quests planned for the whole game.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I started playing WoW, I found out that quests can be received by chatting with non-player characters
            in
            WoW whoever has the yellow exclamation mark on top of his/her head. I could easily recognized where these
            quest
            givers are by referencing the mini-map on the top right of the game screen. When a quest is completed,
            player
            can return to the quest givers to earn rewards. At this point, the quest givers will have yellow question
            marks
            on their heads instead. When a quest is considered as low-level, which means your character level is much
            higher
            than the quest level, the quests indicators will turn grey.
        </p>

        <p>
            In WoW, a player can receive multiple quests at the same time with the maximum of 15 (as I remembered). When
            quests are received, I found it helpful to open the big map (hotkey 'M') to see what the quests are and
            where on
            the map I get to to do my quests, as well as where I should go to find the quest givers to earn rewards.
            Here is
            a screen shot of how the map looks like:

        <br/><br/>

        <p>
            I personally like this feature in WoW the most, especially for beginners. One thing I didn't know about WoW
            is
            that there are many quest types/categories, according to WoW wiki:
        </p>
        <br/><br/>
        <a href="http://blogs.iac.gatech.edu/fall2013lmc3403jr/files/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-11-at-4.04.25-PM.png"><img

                alt="" width="850" height="240"/></a>
        <br/><br/>

        <p>So, I have been only doing solo quests... I guess there are a lot more for me to discover in the World of
            Warcraft. I'm probably going to try to do dungeon quests this weekend to see if it's any different from the
            solo
            quests.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thinking about it, the number of quests in WoW is amazing in consideration of how many hours developers (or
            quest writers) put in detailing these quests. On WoW Wiki, there is a broken hyperlink to something that
            said
            'creating a quest article' to create new quests. Does this mean players can add new quests to WoW? Anyway,
            since
            there is many types of quests in WoW, many quests are 'repeatable', and WoW has been out for a long long
            time, I
            guess a number close to ~10,000 quests is understandable. Here is one thing I don't understand on my
            character
            progress overview page:
        </p>

        <br/><br/>

        <p>What does it mean by 1/196 quests? I'm sure I have completed more than 1 quests and there are obviously more
            than 196 quests in the game...

    <h1 class="post-title">Joining a Guild, why not?</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>If you have ever played MMORPC games before, you probably have heard of the term Guild, or
            Clan. If you haven't heard of it, this is maybe a good post to read. I think guild is probably the best part
            that MMORPC games have.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my simple definition of guild, it is a social network of players that can communicate via a separate
            channel
            in the game. Hmmm, maybe I need a better definition. According to WoW wiki, a guild is an in-game
            association of
            player characters. Guilds are formed to make grouping and raiding easier and more rewarding, as well as to
            form
            a social atmosphere in which to enjoy the game.

        high
        level!
        <br/><br/>

        <p>
            A player would have many benefits when join a guild. I know this because I joined a guild before. I remember
            back in the day when I used to play Priston Tale (an old MMORPC game), joining a guild is what kept me
            playing
            the game. I got to make more friends in game, received free items, enhanced my experience in playing my
            character. Besides all of these, the best experience was to be a part of a small group in a big game
            community
            to compete with others. If the guild is good (like my guild back then), the bonding among players would get
            better and better based on the time a player's been with the guild. I was with my guild for almost 2 years.
            The
            guild wasn't only formed in Priston Tale. It's formed in other MMO games as well when we sort of got bored
            of
            the old game and wanted to try new ones. I 'migrated' to the new games with my guild as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, it's the online community in MMO games. Friends in game are 'imaginary' friends. Do a players actually
            get
            to meet each other face to face? I actually did. My guild used to have 'offline' meeting once or twice a
            month
            for members to meet each other. I got to make 'real' friends in these meetings and gained more experience
            from
            them. Some of these people I met become my mentors, lifelong friends. This was when my perspective about
            game
            online changed. It's a real community.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, if you like to play MMO games, and there are guilds in the game. I absolutely recommend you to pick one
            to
            join. You don't have to stay in the same guild forever like I did. There are players who join and leave
            guilds
            frequently to find the best guild that fit them.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you had been, or have been a member of a guild, what's your experience?

    <h1 class="post-title">Usability Testing Day – One Good Experience</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>It's finally that day, the day our guild matching website got to be tested by users. Our
            team reserved two rooms in the CULC from 12:00 to 3:00pm, each for one and a half hour. A dozen Dunkin
            donuts
            were the incentive for the testers! We ended our usability testing days with 3 testers and some very good
            feedbacks.
        </p>

        <p>

            At first, we spent an hour waiting for our first tester to come. He ended up not showing up. We decided to
            go
            around the CULC to look for 'similar faces' - our friends to ask them be our testers, but no luck. One of
            our
            team member asked his roommate to be a tester for our site and it turned out well. Later, two other students
            came and tested our website. What we should have done is to ask for the testers' confirmation prior to the
            testing time, maybe a couple hours before just to make sure that they would come.
        </p>

        <p>
            I remember a day last year when I was a usability tester for a user interface of a copy machine, the
            experience
            is very similar, except I was on the opposite side. When I was doing the tasks given to me that time, I
            struggled not knowing how to do it because of the unclear interface. I tried to ask questions so that I
            could
            complete the tasks but I didn't get any response. I felt disappointed because I couldn't complete the tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            This time, being on the opposite side, I understand why I couldn't give instructions to the testers. The
            main
            point is to see how the users interact with the website and figure out what to do to complete the assigned
            tasks. If they couldn't complete the tasks, it's a failure of our team didn't have a good design for the
            website.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I was recording video of the testers' interactions, I paid close attention to how the testers navigate
            through our websites. It's interesting to see the testers did things that we wouldn't think that they would
            do.
            Even though we thought we gave the testers clear instructions, it's not that clear if we're the user. I've
            learned that it's very important to put ourselves in users' position to test our website so that we could
            avoid
            allowing users to do unexpected thing on the site.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I think our team usability testing day was successful. If I we had a second testing day, I would
            try to
            find a female testers and have more than three testers so we can have diversity in our data.

    <h1 class="post-title">WoW Profession – Herbalism</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This week, I tried to finish one of project 1 assignments - becoming professional. My
            character professions are Herbalism and First Aid.
        </p>

        <p>
            First Aid profession was very easy to level up. All I needed to do was fighting mobs, collect a specific
            item,
            then turn it to band-aid. I was able to level it up to 50 while I was just doing quests.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, Herbalism profession was much harder to level up for me. At first, I did not know how to
            gather herbs in WoW. I read the description about Herbalism in game but it didn't help me much on how to
            find
            the herbs. I know that I could gather herbs by clicking on the random blinking green bush, but I where are
            they?
            After almost half an hour looking for these bushes, found out their is a feature on the mini-map to display
            where these bushes are.

        <br/><br/>

        <p>
            These green bushes don't appear quickly. I ran around for more than an hour but found only 10 of them. I
            gave up
            and started googling 'WoW Herbalism" to look for help. This map from a WoW website helped me to speed up
            leveling Herbalism profession a little bit.

        <p>Now both of my professions Herbalism and First Aid are level 50 and above. I only need to win a battle ground
            to
            finish project 1 assignment. I'm so looking forward to finishing it.

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>It's has been quite a journey. A total of 10 journal posts were written by me in the past
            12
            weeks. I have never written this many journal posts before so this is definitely quite a big achievement for
            me.
            To be honest, I absolutely hate writing. Being a foreigner, English is my second language. I can stay in a
            conversation, verbally, or chatting, for a long time, but when it comes to professional writing, I am
            definitely
            worst at it. In the beginning of the semester, these weekly journal posts seem like an easy assignment,
            however,
            it's not when I started it. I used to spend a couple hours or more just to write 500 words.

            For this semester, I have written 4 exploration posts and 6 reflection posts. This number surprised me. When
            I
            first started working on this assignment, I always thought that I would write more exploration posts than
            reflection posts. The reason is that I get to play World of Warcraft and talk about what I discover in the
            game.
            I started my series of journal post discussing about my perspective of playing MMO games, and ended with an
            exploration on WoW profession. I may write one more exploration on WoW Battle Ground if there is time for
            extra
            credit though.
        </p>

            As the semester goes by, I actually did not enjoy playing WoW that much as I thought I would. I quit playing
            MMO
            games for quite a long time, 7 years, and now it's not the same feelings while playing it anymore. At one
            point,
            I stopped playing WoW for a long time and started writing reflection posts on other topic in class. Even
            though
            I didn't write exploration posts, my reflection posts are somewhat related to WoW. My favorite reflection
            post
            is about how WoW player should join a guild.

            What have helped me learned in the progress of writing journal posts are the feedbacks I received from
            classmates' comments. At first, I didn't think that anyone would like to read my posts because of bad
            grammar
            and boring topics. But my classmates actually spent time to read it and gave great feedbacks that encourage
            me
            to write more in the following weeks. I notice that adding screenshots, images to the posts helped the
            audience
            to understand the topic better, and more WOVEN.
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I believe weekly journal helped me to document my thoughts, explorations in the class. I totally
            still
            think that my writing is the worst ever, but I have more confidence to write now. Thanks to the blog
            community.
