            <h1 class="post-title">How to Create A New Character in World of Warcraft</h1>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>The first task that all the new players need to complete before they can
                    enjoy the game is creating their World of Warcraft (WoW) character. This instruction will
                    show
                    you step by step how to create your first WoW character. You will need as quick as 5 minutes
                    to
                    complete this instruction and have your character ready to play. After completing this
                    instruction, you will be able to create as many 50 characters per user account, with no more
                    than 10 characters per realm.</p>

                <p><em>Note: Before going any further, a World of Warcraft Battle.net account is required before
                        completing any steps of this instruction. You should already have a Battle.net account
                        after
                        downloading the game. If not, please visit http://us.battle.net/wow/en/ to create an
                        account.
                    </em></p>

                <h4>Step 1: Choose to create a new character
                </h4>
                <em>[Note: You can skip this step if you do not have any characters created yet!]</em>

                <p>If you already have a character, or characters created, you will see the screen
                    similar to the
                    screenshot below.</p>

                <img src="images/image01.png"/>

                <p>Mouse your cursor over “Create New Character” button on the bottom right of the
                    screen and click
                    on it to go to the main character creation screen.</p>
                <h4>Step 2: Pick the race and class of your character</h4>

                <p>As of the latest WoW version Mist of Pandaria, there are two playable factions, the
                    Alliance and
                    the Horde. Each faction is comprised of six different races who can play variety of
                    different
                    classes, and there is special one race – Pandaren – who can join either Alliance or
                    Horde.
                    The character races are on the left side. The classes that go with a race are on the
                    right side
                    of the screen. Each race can only go with certain classes.</p>

                <em>[Note: If you never created a character before in a realm, you will be directed to
                    this screen
                    right after login]</em>

                <img src="images/image03.png"/>

                <p>Pick the race and class that you would like your character to be. To see more
                    information about
                    your chosen race and class, click the “More Info” button on the bottom left of the
                    screen. The
                    screenshot above shows an example of race Pandaren, class Rogue chosen with
                    additional
                    information.</p>


                <h4>Step 3: Customize the look of your character</h4>

                <p>After you have picked the race and class of your character, click “Customize” button
                    located at
                    the bottom of the screen to go to the next screen. On this screen, you will be able
                    to customize
                    the look of your character. You can choose the gender of your character by toggling
                    the
                    male/female gender icon buttons. You can also randomize the look by clicking the
                    “Randomize”
                    button.</p>

                <img src="images/image05.png" rel="image"/>

                <h4>Step 4: Name your character
                </h4>

                <p>This is the simplest but probably the most difficult step, naming your
                    character.</p>

                <em>[Note: Only the first character of the name will be capitalized. Any
                    uppercase characters in the
                    name but not the first one will be convert to lowercase character after
                    character creation]</em>


                <h4>Step 5: Finish creating your character</h4>

                <p>Finally, click the “Finish” button the finish your character creation!</p>


                <p>Congratulation! You just created a new character in World of Warcraft. After
                    character creation,
                    a cinema about your character will be shown to give you a little more cool
                    background about your
                    character. Enjoy the game!</p>

            <h1 class="post-title">How to Find and Complete a Quest in World of Warcraft</h1>

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>A quest is a task given to a player character that yields a reward when
                    completed. Rewards can be experience points (XP) or game items. According to WoW Wiki, there are
                    currently more than 9,500 quests in WoW. This instruction will have you to find and complete a
                    quest, also with a few tips and tricks. Depend on the difficulty of the assigned quest, you will
                    need roughly 15 minutes to complete this instruction with a simple low level quest, or up to a
                    couple hours for a very complex one.</p>

                <em>Note: This instruction assumes you already have a character created in World of Warcraft.</em>

                <h4>Step 1: Find the quest givers and talk to them</h4>

                <p>Quests can be received by chatting with non-player characters in WoW. These characters have
                    yellow exclamation marks on top of his/her heads as indicators of quest givers. One easy way to
                    find these quest givers is by referencing the mini-map to look for the quest givers.</p>

                <img src="images/image001.png"/>
                <img src="images/image003.png"/>
                <img src="images/image005.png"/>


                <p>When you meet one of these characters, chat with him/her to receive a quest.</p>


                <h4>Step 2: Accept the quests from the quest givers</h4>

                <p>When you talk to the quest givers, you will be assigned tasks to complete to earn rewards. The
                    rewards can be experience points (XP), game money, and/or game items. Choose to accept the quest
                    by clicking the “Accept” button. Be sure to read the instructions of tasks need to complete
                    before accepting the quest. Now you’re ready to do a quest.</p>

                <img src="images/image007.png"/>


                <h4>Step 3: Go to quest assigned location to complete asked tasks</h4>

                <p>When you accepted to do a quest, you either need to go find another non-player character to talk
                    to, or go to a particular area on the map to complete your tasks. You can reference the mini-map
                    to go to the quest area. It’s also helpful to open the big map (hotkey “M”) to see more details
                    of your quests.</p>

                <img src="images/image011.png"/>

                <h4>Step 4: Return to the quest givers to earn rewards</h4>

                <p>When you completed the assigned tasks in a quest, return to the quest givers and chat with them
                    again to earn your rewards. If you don’t remember who or where the quest givers were, use the
                    map as the reference. At this time, the indicator of quest givers will change to yellow question
                    mark (?). It indicates that you have completed your quest and can talk to quest givers to earn
                    rewards.</p>

                <p>Congratulation! You just completed a quest in World of Warcraft. There are a lot more quests in
                    this game. This instruction helped you to complete one all purpose solo quest in WoW. There are
                    other types of quests such as dungeon quests, guild quests, etc… It’s very similar to receive
                    those other types of quests in WoW so you will have no problem to find those. Below are some
                    tips and tricks in doing quest in WoW. Enjoy!</p>


                <strong>Tips and Tricks:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>- A player can receive multiple quests at the same with the maximum of 15 quests.</li>
                    <li>- Try to receive as many quests in the same location as you could. These quests assigned areas
                        are
                        usually near each other. You can complete more than a quest at a time and return them all at
                        once.
                    </li>
                    <li>- You don’t have to complete every single quest in WoW. Try to explore the world more rather
                        than just doing quests.
                    </li>
                    <li>- If the quests are too low level for you, the quests indicator will turn grey. This means the
                        rewards won’t be as good and you should find more higher level quests to do.
                    </li>
                </ul>
